bat - syntax highlights csv files, and many others
csvlens & tidy viewer - great viewers for CSV files, beautiful and fun
qsv - filter, sort, combine, join... (a fork of xsv)
Terminal::Table - wonderful rubygem for pretty printing tables, great for non-hash data like confusion matrices
visidata - the best for poking around large files, it does everything
